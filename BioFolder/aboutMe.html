    <h2>Who is Charlie?</h2>
    <div id="intro"><p> My full name is Charlie Macfarlane Brodie, I have recently completed a Masters Degree 
    in Computer Science from the university of Birkbeck and I've subsequently decided to create this website 
    to showcase my innumerable talents to potential employers/employees/internet errata. </p>
    </div>
    
    <br />
    <p> More generally I'm a friendly guy who needs a job, for more details about how I could benefit your company, 
    I have enumerate countless applicable superlatives in my CV, which you can download and read at your leisure 
    <a href="/../contact/CV_charlieBrodie.pdf">here</a>. </p>
    
    <h2>What is Charlie doing?</h2>
    
    <p>
        At the moment I'm between occupations, as such I'm trying to indulge in all the things I love most; reading, programming
        listening to music, making music. But this is boring and uninformative! if you really want to know what I'm up to at the
        moment you can get clarifications on all of the above in other sections of my website.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Why Charlie?</h2>
    
    <p>
        This is a complex and multifacet question, I'm probably going to need a fairly heavy amount of elaboration and even
        then there's no guarantee I'm going to be able to provide a comprehensive answer. They do however say that a picture
        speaks a thousand words so instead of rattling on about my various qualities and/or life philosophies I'll just provide
        some nice simple keywords accompanied by pictures.
